Project Description:
This project is designed to streamline employee training management within an organization. It ensures that employee records are stored efficiently and training sessions are tracked accurately for better visibility and accountability. The system includes built-in validation to prevent negative durations, maintaining data integrity.

Additionally, automated email notifications keep employees and managers informed about training schedules and updates. Comprehensive reports and dashboards provide valuable insights to HR and management teams for performance analysis and decision-making. Robust security measures are implemented to ensure that each user type has appropriate access based on their role, maintaining data confidentiality and system integrity.
